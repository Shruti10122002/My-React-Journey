# My React Journey ðŸš€

## Introduction
Welcome to my React journey! This repository is a collection of projects and topics that I've learned and explored while mastering React.

## Key Milestones

### 1. Day 1 - First React Project: Hello World!
- **Commit:** `Day1-react`
- **Description:** This was my introduction to React where I set up my environment and created a simple "Hello World" app using JSX and basic React components.

### 2. Conditional Rendering
- **Commit:** `Conditional Rendering/render`
- **Description:** I learned how to conditionally render components in React based on the application state. This involved using JavaScript expressions within JSX to display certain elements only when certain conditions are met.

### 3. Hooks: `useContext`
- **Commit:** `Hook3usecontext/hook3`
- **Description:** I explored the `useContext` hook for managing global state in React without needing to prop-drill. This helped simplify passing data between deeply nested components.

### 4. `useEffect` Hook
- **Commit:** `LearnUseEffect/hook-useffect`
- **Description:** In this section, I learned how to handle side effects in functional components with the `useEffect` hook, such as fetching data from APIs, interacting with DOM elements, and managing component lifecycle methods.

### 5. React Routing
- **Commit:** `React-Routing/react-router`
- **Description:** I implemented navigation in a React app using `react-router`. This enabled dynamic routing and allowed me to create a multi-page React application with navigation links.

### 6. React Form Handling
- **Commit:** `ReactForm/form`
- **Description:** I built a form in React using the `react-hook-form` library, learning how to manage form validation, handle user input, and process form submission in an efficient manner.

## What I Learned
- **JSX and Components:** Created modular and reusable components.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displayed UI elements based on state and logic.
- **Hooks:**
  - `useState` and `useEffect`: Managed state and side effects in functional components.
  - `useContext`: Passed data globally without prop drilling.
- **React Router:** Enabled dynamic routing and navigation.
- **Form Handling:** Managed forms and validations efficiently with `react-hook-form`.

## Future Goals
I'm excited to:
- Explore advanced topics like Next.js for server-side rendering.
- Optimize performance for large-scale React applications.
- Contribute to React open-source projects.
